Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a
function of the length of the input. 

O(1)
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
O(n2)

Binary Search - O(log n)
Linear Search - O(n)

Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm 
to run as a function of the length of the input.
