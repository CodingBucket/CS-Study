Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a
function of the length of the input. 

Maximum steps or Upper bound or Worst case.

O(1) - Order of one
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
O(n2)

Binary Search - O(log n)
Linear Search - O(n)

Minimun steps or Lower bound or Best case.

Ω(1)
Ω(log n)
Ω(n)
Ω(n log n)
Ω(n2)

Linear Search - Ω(1)

When upper and lower bound are same for an algorithom then we use Θ to descrive the compexity.

Θ(1)
Θ(log n)
Θ(n)
Θ(n log n)
Θ(n2)

Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm 
to run as a function of the length of the input.
